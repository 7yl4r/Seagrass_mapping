**1) Seagrass map for Venezuela**

Ground truth: a database with all seagrass data points was created; the data points were extrated from the literature. In addition, an old database created for the whole Caribbeanre was re-used. My "raw" database has some columns with information that goes beyond ground truthing. Is for a more ecological assessment. That data will be re-considered later on.
The data points from the raw database has been filtered and the column names has benn re-organized to fit for purpose. 

New habitat type records need to be added, e. g. sand, corals, etc.

Data from OBIS and from a seagrass mapping article for Los Roques Island need to be added.

Data from Colombia and Belize needs to be added.
