**1) Seagrass map for Venezuela**

Ground truth: a database with all seagrass data points was created; the data points were extrated from the literature. In addition, an old database created for the whole Caribbeanre was re-used. My "raw" database has some columns with information that goes beyond ground truthing. Is for a more ecological assessment. That data will be re-considered later on.
The data points from the raw database has been filtered and the column names has been re-organized to fit for purpose. 

New habitat type records need to be added, e. g. sand, corals, etc.

Data from OBIS and from a seagrass mapping article for Los Roques Island need to be added.

Data from Colombia and Belize needs to be added.

**2) Seagrass map for USVI**

Collaborative work with Edwin Cruz-Rivera (institute???)

May be part of Chealsea's master thesis

Currently in the exploration stage; now reviewing GEE codes and exploring Sentinel 2 images. Need to explore different time ranges beacuse there are to much clouds in the output images.

**3) Seagrass map for Belize**

_Workflow_

1.- Groundtruth database creation: data points taken from Claudias visit to Belize, GPS data recording and bothom type identification. Seagrass data points from SegrassNet site. No seagrass occurrence data in OBIS. Scleractinia data points taken from OBIS. 

2.- Image selection: region of interest, time frame of the collection.
