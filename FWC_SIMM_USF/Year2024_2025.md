# ROADMAP

## Phase 1: current seagrass cover for St. Andrews Bay

**Creating the image collection** 

Satellite images will be acquired through the Commercial Small Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program
Make the request to NASA for CSDA through IMaRS project
Receive the approval and get acces to the different providers imagery (see CSDA-NASA email with instruction)
  For this project we will use Planet: acces and image downloads through Planet account; password provided by CSDA-NASA
  Planet imagery can be accessed through API (limited number of requests)

Get images for specific dates/season and AOI
Select the best images to use for classification
  Top of the atmosphere collection
  Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) mean values of valid pixels
  

**Creating the groundtruth data points inventory**

Gather all ground-truth data points possible. Search on different sources (Literature, Projects, OBIS, etc.)
See Luis Lizcano-Sandoval database 

## Phase 2: Image pre-processing

Atmospheric correction (ACOLITE?)
Masks: clouds, glint, land (create and inventory of posible mask algorithms for GEE)
Depth Invariant Index (DII)

## Phase 3: Image classification

Select coastal, Blue, Green, Red, DII bands
Sample bands with ground-truth dataset (70% training, 30% validation) 
Train SVM model and classify (other models?)
Get accuracies and Kappa coefficients

## Phase 4: Post classification
TBD
