# ROADMAP

## Phase 1: current seagrass cover for St. Andrew Bay

**Creating the image collection** 

1. Satellite images will be acquired through the Commercial Small Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program
2. Make the request to NASA for CSDA through IMaRS project
3. Receive the approval and get acces to the different providers imagery (see CSDA-NASA email with instruction)
   
   For this project we will use Planet: acces and image downloads through Planet account; password provided by CSDA-NASA
   Planet imagery can be accessed through API (limited number of requests)

4. Get images for specific dates/season and AOI
5. Select the best images to use for classification
   
   
  Top of the atmosphere collection
  Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) mean values of valid pixels
  
**Creating the groundtruth data points inventory**

Gather all ground-truth data points possible. Search on different sources (Literature, Projects, OBIS, etc.)
See Luis Lizcano-Sandoval database 

**Image pre-processing**

1. Atmospheric correction (ACOLITE?)
2. Masks: clouds, glint, land (create and inventory of posible mask algorithms for GEE)
3. Depth Invariant Index (DII)

**Image classification**

1. Select coastal, Blue, Green, Red, DII bands
2. Sample bands with ground-truth dataset (70% training, 30% validation) 
3. Train SVM model and classify (other models?)
4. Get accuracies and Kappa coefficients

**Post classification**

TBD
